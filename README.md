# University of Denver Coding Bootcamp Project #2: 
## Smash Wireless

This is a full stack app that is designed to streamline the management of corporate mobile plans.  Smash Wireless is a placeholder name for any cellular company such as AT&T or Verizon. The user of this platform,in this case, would be the manager of the corporate plans.  With this app, the manager can select all companies that have corporate plans with the mobile provider. From there, the manager can view specific plan information for that company, as well as current overall data usage.  They can also add new unique lines with specific data and device plans, or update existing plans.
